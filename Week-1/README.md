What is a protocol stack, and how is it used in web development?

Protocol Stack or network stack is set of layers used for communication over the internet where each data in the internet passes in this set of layers starting from physical layer to Application layer. The List of layers are Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, Session Layer, Presentation Layer & Application Layer. We will look in what each layer is responsible for,

- DataLink Layer : Where the data enters or exits in the internet via Ethernet or Wireless Lan.
- Network Layer : Responsible for routing data packets where the data finds the IP(v4/v6) needed to reach the host
- Transport Layer : This layer is responsile for deciding the protocol (TCP / UDP) over on which the data packets trasmits.
- Application Layer : After passing in to all layers, data finally reaches the app layer which is handled by the application server. This is where the web application resides

- Reseller Hosting : Reseller hosting allows individuals or businesses to resell hosting services. They purchase server resources and then allocate them to clients as needed

What is scaling, and why is it important for web applications? How does scaling differ for vertical and horizontal scaling?

Scaling refers to increasing the website capacity to handle more users,traffic and requests. Its important to avoid slower response delivery, site crash when larger requests happens.
